A curated list of software libraries and tools that I use(d) on a regular basis. 

## Python libraries for robotics
- [moderngl](https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl) - a Python wrapper for OpenGL
- [networkx](https://networkx.org/) - a library to manage graphs
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - the Python standard for vectorized maths
- [open3d](https://www.open3d.org/) - 3D data processing and visualization
- [opencv](https://opencv.org/) - a comprehensive computer vision library
- [pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) - high-performance rigid body dynamics
- [scipy](https://scipy.org/) - fundamental algorithms for scientific computing

## Simulation
- [Bullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) - a modular open-source physics engine, provided as a Python library (pybullet)
- [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home) - a comprehensive suite of simulation tools, developed for a long time alongside ROS and used widely in the research community
- [Unity](https://unity.com/) - a proprietary game engine with high-end physics and graphics, and VR support
    - check out the [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub) for dedicated robotics tools, in particular integration with ROS

## Visualization
- [foxglove](https://foxglove.dev/) - robotics visualization tool with a focus on customizable graphics, can be integrated online or offline (through bags) with ROS
- [manim (community edition)](https://www.manim.community/) \| [manim (3b1b)](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) - a Python library to create math animations from code
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - the Python standard for visualization
- [rqt](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Concepts/About-RQt.html) - ROS-integrated Qt framework with various pre-integrated ROS-related visualization plugins
- [rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) - ROS-integrated customizable 3D visualizer
    - [jsk_rviz_plugins](https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_visualization) - useful additional plugins developed by the JSK lab

## Computer-Aided Design (CAD)
- [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/index.php) - open-source parametric CAD, recently released as 1.0 with numerous improvements
- [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/en/) - browser-based CAD platform with support for collaborative edition; free personal and education licenses
- [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) - code-based parametric modeling, relying on a dedicated language
- [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) - open-source and feature-rich slicer (G-code generator from 3D data) for 3D printing

## Other
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - standard containerization tool, a great help to improve software modularity and compatibility
- [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) - the Robot Operating System, the open-source standard for robotics, provided as a software suite built on a communication middleware; many open-source tools are provided by the research community as ROS packages.
