**Abstract**: In this paper, we propose a new sampling-based path planning approach, focusing on the challenges linked to autonomous exploration. Our method relies on the definition of a disk graph of free-space bubbles, from which we derive a biased sampling function that expands the graph towards known free space for maximal navigability and frontiers discovery. The proposed method demonstrates an exploratory behavior similar to Rapidly-exploring Random Trees, while retaining the connectivity and flexibility of a graph-based planner. We demonstrate the interest of our method by first comparing its path planning capabilities against state-of-the-art approaches, before discussing exploration-specific aspects, namely replanning capabilities and incremental construction of the graph. A simple frontiers-driven exploration controller derived from our planning method is also demonstrated using the Pioneer platform.
